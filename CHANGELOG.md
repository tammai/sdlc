# Changelog

Versions follow the `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Repos record the version they were set up or upgraded with; `/sdlc:upgrade` brings them forward.

## Unreleased

### Security
- **Guardrails:** `sdlc-dangerous-rm` now catches `rm -rf /*`, `~/*`, `./*`, `../..`, `"$HOME"`, `${HOME}`, quoted targets and split or long flags. `sdlc-force-push-main` now catches pushes after `git -C`/`-c`, `-fu`, line continuations, branch deletion and `--mirror`.
- **Guardrails can't be switched off by the agent:** new `sdlc-protect-guardrails-file` and `sdlc-protect-guardrails-bash` block edits, moves and deletes of `.claude/hookify/sdlc-*.md`. Existing repos get them from `/sdlc:upgrade`.
- **Secrets:** blocked in notebook cells and Bash commands too (`sdlc-secret-values-bash`), and the key formats now include `sk-proj-`, `github_pat_`, Stripe live keys and Google API keys.
- **Hookify engine:** rules load from the project root even when a hook starts in a subdirectory; a `block` rule on a prompt now blocks it; broken rules (unknown event, action or operator, invalid regex, no frontmatter) are reported in the hook output and by `/sdlc:doctor` instead of being skipped silently; a BOM, blank first line or capitalised `Block`/`Bash` no longer disarms a rule; a regex that runs over 1 s is skipped; rule messages are capped at 2000 characters.
- **Other:** the reviewer SDK is installed at a pinned version; `/sdlc:ralph-loop` rejects a multi-line `--completion-promise` and warns when no session id is available.

### Changed
- **Upgrades add new plugin files:** `/sdlc:upgrade` now installs policy rules and guardrails that are new in the installed version (an "add" step), so repos set up earlier get them. Files you handed back with "keep mine" (`forget`) are remembered and never re-added; a file of yours with the same name is never overwritten.
- **Monorepo verify:** the orchestrator records the commit a feature starts from (`Base:` in `state.md`); in Stage 5 only packages changed since then need their tests rerun. Without a base, every package does, as before.

### Fixed (from the 1.3.0 release smoke test)
- Greenfield setup no longer creates or edits `CLAUDE.md`; the knowledge pointer lives in `.claude/rules/sdlc.md`.
- `/sdlc:doctor` no longer warns about the plugin's own policy rules (e.g. `sdlc-migrations.md`) matching no files yet, and explains that the security reviewer's environment is only built when the security hooks receive credentials.
- `/sdlc:eject` removes the `.sdlc/.work/` scratch folder along with its `.gitignore` line.
- Setup reports a step it skips as not applicable (with the reason) when it skips it, not only in the final report.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-22

### Added
- **Project setup:** `/sdlc:setup` for new and existing repos. Records the repo's own commands in `.sdlc/config.json` (per package in a monorepo), a known-failures baseline, a deep audit into knowledge and area rules, policy rules, guardrails, lint snippets, an allowlist, generated CI, constitution and knowledge. Runs on a branch, resumable.
- **Upgrades and removal:** `/sdlc:upgrade` (regenerate plugin files, ask before touching edited ones, versioned migrations) and `/sdlc:eject`. File ownership is tracked in `.sdlc/scaffold.lock.json`.
- **`/sdlc:doctor`:** read-only health check of machine, plugin and repo, with a fix per problem.
- **Scope tracing:** `[user]`/`[clarified]`/`[inferred]` requirement tags and Non-Goals in specs (inferred items dropped unless kept); Complexity Tracking for every design addition; task `Requirements:` lines and a Public Surface section in plans; `diff_stats.py --plan` flags undeclared surface in review.
- **Conventions:** policy rules (`.claude/rules/sdlc-*.md`: workflow, code style, tests, migrations, sensitive areas, CI), 11 hookify guardrails (dangerous `rm`, force-push to main, secrets, narrating/history/long comments, suppressions, focused tests, `console.log`), ESLint and Ruff snippets, and `diff_stats.py` facts in every review.
- **Verification:** baseline-aware verifier (fails only on new failures); freshness tracked per package; config-driven test commands.
- **Docs:** guidebook, playbook, runbook, diagrams, CONTRIBUTING; ADRs (`docs/adr/`), a PRD and numbered capability specs with each requirement tied to the test that proves it (`docs/prd.md`, `docs/specs/`); marketplace manifest.

### Changed
- `/sdlc:start` routes to setup when a repo isn't set up and reports version drift; `/sdlc:status` shows setup state.
- Track sizing defaults to the smallest track that fits; sizing up names its signal.
- Default constitution template includes a Simplicity principle.

### Fixed
- Hookify: `new_text` now covers `Write`; new `not_regex_match` operator; warnings reach Claude (`additionalContext`) and blocks say why (`permissionDecisionReason`); committed team rules in `.claude/hookify/*.md`; no more duplicate evaluation after each tool call.
- Ralph loop: stop hook no longer crashes on a state file missing a field.
- Verify freshness: catches edits made outside Edit/Write (worktree fingerprint), single-file and single-package runs, and redirects like `2>&1`.

## 1.2.0

First version: orchestrator with S/M/L tracks and 11 gated stages; vendored skills, agents and commands from Superpowers, GitHub Spec Kit and Anthropic's plugins under the `sdlc:` namespace; fresh verifier per round with the Stage 5 freshness hook; 3-tier knowledge; security-guidance, hookify and ralph-loop hooks; hook test suite.
