# Changelog

Versions follow the `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Repos record the version they were set up or upgraded with; `/sdlc:upgrade` brings them forward.

## Unreleased

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-22

### Added
- **Project setup:** `/sdlc:setup` for new and existing repos. Records the repo's own commands in `.sdlc/config.json` (per package in a monorepo), a known-failures baseline, a deep audit into knowledge and area rules, policy rules, guardrails, lint snippets, an allowlist, generated CI, constitution and knowledge. Runs on a branch, resumable.
- **Upgrades and removal:** `/sdlc:upgrade` (regenerate plugin files, ask before touching edited ones, versioned migrations) and `/sdlc:eject`. File ownership is tracked in `.sdlc/scaffold.lock.json`.
- **`/sdlc:doctor`:** read-only health check of machine, plugin and repo, with a fix per problem.
- **Scope tracing:** `[user]`/`[clarified]`/`[inferred]` requirement tags and Non-Goals in specs (inferred items dropped unless kept); Complexity Tracking for every design addition; task `Requirements:` lines and a Public Surface section in plans; `diff_stats.py --plan` flags undeclared surface in review.
- **Conventions:** policy rules (`.claude/rules/sdlc-*.md`: workflow, code style, tests, migrations, sensitive areas, CI), 11 hookify guardrails (dangerous `rm`, force-push to main, secrets, narrating/history/long comments, suppressions, focused tests, `console.log`), ESLint and Ruff snippets, and `diff_stats.py` facts in every review.
- **Verification:** baseline-aware verifier (fails only on new failures); freshness tracked per package; config-driven test commands.
- **Docs:** guidebook, playbook, runbook, diagrams, CONTRIBUTING; ADRs (`docs/adr/`), a PRD and numbered capability specs with each requirement tied to the test that proves it (`docs/prd.md`, `docs/specs/`); marketplace manifest.

### Changed
- `/sdlc:start` routes to setup when a repo isn't set up and reports version drift; `/sdlc:status` shows setup state.
- Track sizing defaults to the smallest track that fits; sizing up names its signal.
- Default constitution template includes a Simplicity principle.

### Fixed
- Hookify: `new_text` now covers `Write`; new `not_regex_match` operator; warnings reach Claude (`additionalContext`) and blocks say why (`permissionDecisionReason`); committed team rules in `.claude/hookify/*.md`; no more duplicate evaluation after each tool call.
- Ralph loop: stop hook no longer crashes on a state file missing a field.
- Verify freshness: catches edits made outside Edit/Write (worktree fingerprint), single-file and single-package runs, and redirects like `2>&1`.

## 1.2.0

First version: orchestrator with S/M/L tracks and 11 gated stages; vendored skills, agents and commands from Superpowers, GitHub Spec Kit and Anthropic's plugins under the `sdlc:` namespace; fresh verifier per round with the Stage 5 freshness hook; 3-tier knowledge; security-guidance, hookify and ralph-loop hooks; hook test suite.
